            <h2>Cryptography</h2>
            <section id="introduction">
                <p>Cryptography is essential for national security in the cyber world. It involves the use of mathematical
                    algorithms to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information, ensuring that only authorized parties can access
                    it. This is crucial for protecting government communications, military operations, and critical
                    infrastructure from cyber threats.
                    <br><br>
                    By continuing to increase the amount of IoT devices, it has become increasingly important to implement strong cryptographic 
                    measures to secure these devices. As described in the "Colony Collapse" scenario, by forging cryptographic keys,
                    attackers can gain unauthorized access to IoT devices, leading to widespread disruption including gas pumps that 
                    stop working or cars that fail to start. 
                    <br><br>
                    There are several ways in which cryptographic methods keep protect our national security.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Symetric encryption</strong>, specifically Advanced Encryption Standard, is used to protect classified and operational communication</li>
                        <li><strong>Public-key cryptography</strong> enables key exchange and digital signatures for authentication of software and firmware and secure 
                            inter-agency links</li>
                        <li><strong>Randomness sources</strong> provide unpredictable information to random number generators to create unguessable keys, enable secure
                        handshakes, and protect integrity checks</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
