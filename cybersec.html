                    <p>Cybersecurity is essential to both national and economical security. The digital space
                        has become the new battleground for intelligence collection, surveillance and
                        stealth attacks which may go undetected for long periods of time.
                        <br><br>
                        Since the start of the war, Russia has carried out cyberattacks on Ukraine, targeting critical
                        infrastructure like power, communications and logistics to degrade its abilty to function. The
                        Russians used disruption techniques like malware and DDoS attacks in its operations against
                        Ukraine.
                        <br><br>
                        Cyber security can help prevent such attacks from crippling a nation's capabilities, especially
                        during war.
