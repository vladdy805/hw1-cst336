                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>Digital forensics is a critical component of national security in the cyber world. It
                        involves
                        the investigation and analysis of digital devices to uncover evidence of cybercrimes and
                        security
                        breaches. Computer science plays a vital role in developing advanced tools and techniques
                        for digital
                        forensics, enabling experts to recover data, trace cyber attacks, and identify perpetrators.
                        <br><br>
                        By using concealed credit card skimmers, hackers can steal sensitive financial information
                        from unsuspecting victims.
                        These skimmers use inexpensive bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology combined with
                        Python-based scripts to transmit
                        stolen data wirelessly to the attacker. These low cost devices exploit vulnerabilities in
                        point-of-sale systems,
                        posing significant threats to national security.
                        <br><br>
                        So what tools are used in digital forensics to combat these threats?
                        <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><mark>Wireshark<mark> is used to inspect BLE payloads and to fingerprint configurations
                        </li>
                        <li><mark>Ubertooth One</mark> is used as passive BLE sniffing to capture advertising
                            traffic</li>
                        <li><mark>Script monitoring</mark> flags when BLE advertising stops, indicating a live
                            conection to a skimmer</li>
                    </ul>
